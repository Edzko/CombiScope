# PM3394 CombiScope Software
Software to interface with the PM33XX / PM3394 Fluke Phillips Combiscopes

## Installation
This project consists of 3 distinct versions:


1. **PM3394A** is built in Visual Studio 2008 as Dialog Window,
2. **PM33XX** is for Visual Studio 2008 with Windows SDK 7.1 and Ribbon interface, and
3. **PM33XX_MFC** is for Visual Studio 2018 with MFC and Single Document interface with Ribbon UI.

Projects have been tested in Windows 7 and Windows 10.

## Features
Connect to the PM33XX CombiScope with a Serial COM port.
Capture a hardcopy or the channel/memory data from the scope to display.

Use cursors to analyze the data.
Use the Info button to add legend on the right side of the chart with information about the signals and cursors.

Click "copy" to add a snapshot of the current view on the clipboard. Paste in any other Windows program as a table with numerical data, a DIB picture or enhanced Metafile.
Or print the current view directly to a printer.

Use any of the FFT Windowing functions to view the Spectrum analysis of the signals. You can choose to set X and/or Y axis in log or linear scale.
