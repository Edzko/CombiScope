Cursors should stay at X/Y when window is resizing, and in print --> associate cursor with V/T
	Cursors should be associated with V and datapnt, and not with screen pnts
	Cursors should adjust when Info toggles
	Cursors should indicate frequency in FFT mode
	Cursors X-only: Add 'X' intersection with the selected trace
	Allow to select a trace when not controlling the cursors. Add cursor Handles??
Function keys ??

FFT button diabled when no trace selected
FFT mode off when new traced downloaded or loaded from file
FFT min and max can be used to find min and max of the y-scale
Make global npoints, and use wherever trace.ndata
Call SetTraceData before OpenTraceFile and GetTrace
Do spectrum for all traces when in fftMode ??

Store trace Enable Switches in Registry

Load trace from excel and send it to the scope
Send waveforms back to Scope
Filter tool (filtfilt with coef)

Disable buttons when not connected, e.g. Hardcopy, Gettrace, Autosetup

Save file (same filename) adds double entry in MRU list
Save As JPG, PNG, BMP, TIF, PDF  
    Remove individual "Save as" icons in the menu, and allow "Save As" in the SaveFile Dlg filetype

Disable zoom button when bitmap hardcopy is downloaded, and re-enable when file is loaded or traces are downloaded
  --> Set Application Mode 

No cursors or info when displaying bitmap
Once BMP is created (hardcopy), GetTraces should remove BMP to show traces again
Get last comport from registry and select at startup

Add font option for labels, axes grid and info and annotation
Add Y-label and Title. In Bold
Add Text Annotation. 
	Track mouse move location. When WM_CHAR, activate "amAnnotating" until CR
